# RONA - IBM CALL FOR CODE 2020 Submission

## Problem Targeted
Drug shortage in hospitals and health care facilities is a big problem here in Kenya, where people are forced to go looking for medicines in local pharmaceutical shops and chemists

The problem is further aggrevated during this pandemic where some patients may need to self isolate and they are still supposed to search for the drugs that were unavailable in hospitals.

## The Solution
RONA is a solution that enables users to locate near pharmaceutical stores from the comfort of their home. They see where they can get the drugs they have made a search for and also, the price.

Rona also comes equipped with a smart AI chatBOT that allows users to do a self COVID19 diagnosis on the platform

The platform also offers a live visualized analytics platform, that is tuned to provide granular risk assessment and real-time trend analysis across the country.

This analytics feature tracks covid19 infection level per county and with the hospital data, we will be able to detect stress on the healthcare system at county level.
